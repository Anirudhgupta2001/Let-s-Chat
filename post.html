                                enjoy) my life accordingly, but every once in a while it tries to snatch the steering

                        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Last night just sucked. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, like my
                                airway was closing up. I couldn’t focus on anything. I was dizzy. I was discouraged. I
                                was irritable and wanted to be alone. I was scared to be alone. I was angry. I was
                                having an internal battle and no one knew. I had been doing so good. How did this
                                happen?</span></p>

                                as aware. I left myself vulnerable to The Beast, and it tried to take over last night.
                                I’m pretty well-versed at shutting that shit down at this point, but last night it took
                                me by surprise. And it took me by surprise because I wasn’t paying attention.</span></p>
                        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">It’s so important to notice those early warning signs — to be
                                aware of when things are getting worse. It doesn’t happen overnight. It takes a lot of
                                practice and self-reflection to notice them. Ask yourself these questions. Ask someone
                                you trust — someone who knows you well and intimately — what they’ve noticed before your

                                noticed I had been having irrational thoughts about my health. I would have noticed that
                                thinking my friend got in a wreck and died just because she was late was probably not
                                the most rational reaction. I would have noticed I had been crying more than usual. I
                                would have noticed my fingernails looked awful and I had been nauseous pretty often
                                lately and I have had more of a negative thought pattern the past week or so. And maybe,
                                I could have prevented The Beast from trying to snatch the wheel last night.</span></p>
                        <p class="p3"><span class="s2">Today is a new day, though, and I’m feeling more positive and
                                peaceful. I snuggled with my son&nbsp;for an extra 30 minutes this morning. I’m writing.
                                I’ll finish the book I’m currently reading. I’ll re-pot some of my plants and swing by
                                Hobby Lobby for a stroll. I’ll drink extra water today. I’ll love on my dogs. We have to
                                know when things are getting worse so we can do the things we know will make it better.
